# Sidebar Redesign — Phase 4 Extended Scope

> **Status**: 🔁 Incremental rollout
> **Date**: 2026-03-22
> **Scope**: `apps/erify_studios/src/config/sidebar-config.tsx`, `apps/erify_studios/src/lib/constants/studio-route-access.ts`
> **Triggered by**: Phase 4 extended PRDs — member roster, creator roster, compensation line items, show planning export, economics/P&L UI

> **Current implementation note**: The core regrouping is already live on `master` for `My Workspace`, `Operations`, `Studio Settings`, and `Creators`, including shipped `members` and `creatorRoster` access keys. The `Reports` split, `showPlanningExport`, `compensation`, and `economics` entries remain future follow-up work.

## Why Now

The current sidebar was designed for a single studio with limited management surface. Phase 4 extended scope adds:
- Studio member roster (`/studios/$studioId/members`)
- Creator roster write surface (`/studios/$studioId/creators`)
- Compensation management (`/studios/$studioId/compensation`)
- Show planning export (`/studios/$studioId/shows/planning-export`)
- Economics / P&L UI (future, `/studios/$studioId/economics`)

The current group structure does not have natural homes for these features and has labeling problems that will worsen as the surface grows.

## Current Shipped State

Source file: `apps/erify_studios/src/config/sidebar-config.tsx`

### Group: My Workspace

- Label: `"My Workspace"`
- Icon: `Videotape`
- Items:
  - Dashboard — `LayoutDashboard`
  - My Tasks — `ListTodo`
  - My Shifts — `CalendarDays`
- Access: all studio members

### Group: Operations

- Label: `"Operations"`
- Icon: `Settings`
- Items:
  - Shift Schedule — `CalendarDays`
  - Shows — `Film`
  - Show Operations — `Clapperboard`
  - Task Review — `ClipboardCheck`
  - Task Reports — `ClipboardCheck`
- Access: MODERATION_MANAGER, MANAGER, ADMIN (varies by item)

### Group: Studio Settings

- Label: `"Studio Settings"`
- Icon: `ShieldCheck`
- Items:
  - Members — `Users`
  - Shared Fields — `Settings`
  - Task Templates — `ClipboardCheck`
- Access: MANAGER, ADMIN (varies by item)

### Group: Creators

- Label: `"Creators"`
- Icon: `Users`
- Items:
  - Creator Roster — `Users`
  - Creator Mapping — `MonitorPlay`
- Access: MANAGER, TALENT_MANAGER, ADMIN

### Deferred Pieces

1. `Task Reports` still lives under `Operations`; the dedicated `Reports` group has not landed yet.
2. `Show Planning Export` is not shipped, so the `showPlanningExport` route/access key is still deferred.
3. `Compensation` and `Economics / P&L` are not shipped, so the `Finance` group is still deferred.
4. The existing `Operations` group icon/title are shipped, but some icon clean-up originally proposed in this design doc is still optional polish.

## Remaining Target State

Groups are organized by **function** (what you do) rather than **role** (who you are). Role-based access remains enforced by `hasStudioRouteAccess` guards on items, not by group labels.

### Group: Reports

- Label: `"Reports"` — output/analysis; split from "Studio Manager"
- Icon: `BarChart2` (lucide-react: `BarChart2`)
- Items:
  - Task Reports — `ClipboardCheck`
  - Show Planning Export — `FileDown` (lucide-react: `FileDown`) — **new**
- Access:
  - Task Reports: MODERATION_MANAGER, MANAGER, ADMIN (unchanged)
  - Show Planning Export: MANAGER, ADMIN (new `showPlanningExport` key)

### Group: Creators

Already shipped on `master`. No further structural changes are required here unless iconography is revisited.

### Group: Finance

- Label: `"Finance"` — new group for P&L and economics UI
- Icon: `TrendingUp` (lucide-react: `TrendingUp`)
- Items:
  - Compensation — `Wallet` (lucide-react: `Wallet`) — **new**
  - Economics / P&L — `TrendingUp` — **new** (when shipped)
- Access:
  - Compensation: ADMIN, MANAGER (new `compensation` key)
  - Economics / P&L: ADMIN (new `economics` key)
- Note: Group is omitted from sidebar until at least one item is accessible. Ship when P&L Revenue Workflow PRD is implemented.

### Group: Studio Settings

Already shipped on `master`. The current slug remains `/studios/$studioId/shared-fields`; a nested `/settings/*` layout can still be introduced later if more settings surfaces land.

## Design Notes

### Function over role

The "Studio Manager" / "Studio Admin" split was confusing because both groups were gated by role. The redesign groups by **what the user is doing**:
- Execution work → Operations
- Analysis/output → Reports
- Configuration → Studio Settings
- Financial review → Finance
- Personal work → My Workspace
- Creator assignments → Creators

Role-based access remains enforced via `hasStudioRouteAccess`; it just does not define group labels anymore.

### Task Templates move

Task Templates moves from "Studio Manager" (execution) to "Studio Settings" (configuration). A task template is a definition artifact, not a daily operational item. It belongs alongside Shared Fields under configuration.

### Shared Fields route flattening

`/studios/$studioId/shared-fields` is clearer than a nested `/settings/shared-fields` slug while shared fields remain the only settings surface. If a multi-page settings area ships later, the frontend can reintroduce a dedicated settings layout without changing the backend shared-fields API endpoints.

### Finance group deferral

The Finance group is new but should not appear in the sidebar until at least the economics UI ships. The `economics` route access key should be defined now (for preparedness) but the sidebar group is conditionally rendered only when `studioFinanceItems.length > 0`, following the existing pattern for optional groups.

### Sidebar file changes required

1. `sidebar-config.tsx`: keep the shipped function-based groups, split `Task Reports` into a dedicated `Reports` group when planning export/report surfaces expand, and add `Finance` when compensation/economics routes ship.
2. `studio-route-access.ts`: keep shipped `members` and `creatorRoster`; add `compensation`, `economics`, and `showPlanningExport` when those routes ship.
3. New icon imports are only needed when the remaining `Reports` and `Finance` entries land.
