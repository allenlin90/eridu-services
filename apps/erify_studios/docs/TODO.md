# TODO: MC Management Enhancements

## User Association

Currently, system admins can associate an MC with a User by manually entering the User's UID.

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] **User Search/Autocomplete**: Instead of a manual text input for User UID, implement an autocomplete or search-enabled dropdown (e.g., Combobox) to allow finding users by name or email.
- [ ] **Pagination/Infinite Scroll**: The user search should support pagination or infinite scroll to handle a large number of users efficiently.
- [ ] **Filtering**: Filter out users who are already associated with an MC to prevent duplicates or invalid associations.
