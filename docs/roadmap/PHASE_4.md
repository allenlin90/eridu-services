## Goal

Build the L-side (cost) of P&L on existing studio entities and finish studio operational autonomy so studios stop depending on `/system/*` routes. Phase 4 produces **read-only reference figures** — no money moves, no payment processing, no bank reconciliation, no dispute workflow.

## Shipped

- ✅ **Wave 1 — Studio autonomy** (1.1-1.5): sidebar redesign, creator/member roster, creator onboarding, show management.
- ✅ **Cost model locked**: [`economics-cost-model.md`](../domain/economics-cost-model.md).
- ✅ **2.2 Foundation — Tasks 1-6** ([#59](https://github.com/allenlin90/eridu-services/pull/59), [#60](https://github.com/allenlin90/eridu-services/pull/60), [#62](https://github.com/allenlin90/eridu-services/pull/62)-[#65](https://github.com/allenlin90/eridu-services/pull/65)): compensation line-item APIs, actuals + snapshot readiness, creator-mapping compensation UX, shift workflow UI.
- ✅ **Money library + shift cost + show-operations + compensation review + roster wire types** ([#69](https://github.com/allenlin90/eridu-services/pull/69), [#71](https://github.com/allenlin90/eridu-services/pull/71)-[#75](https://github.com/allenlin90/eridu-services/pull/75), [#77](https://github.com/allenlin90/eridu-services/pull/77)-[#85](https://github.com/allenlin90/eridu-services/pull/85)): rows 1-11.6 in the table below.
- ✅ **Creator-mapping operations through 11.6.5** ([#83](https://github.com/allenlin90/eridu-services/pull/83)-[#85](https://github.com/allenlin90/eridu-services/pull/85), [#89](https://github.com/allenlin90/eridu-services/pull/89)): cross-user reads, show context, client filter, current-view export. 11.x closed.
- ✅ **Client mechanics design reset** ([#87](https://github.com/allenlin90/eridu-services/pull/87)) — implementation tracked as 14.x.
- ✅ **PR 12 design locked** ([#90](https://github.com/allenlin90/eridu-services/pull/90)): [`TASK_INPUT_FACT_BINDING_DESIGN.md`](../../apps/erify_api/docs/design/TASK_INPUT_FACT_BINDING_DESIGN.md). Implementation split into 12.0.1-12.4 below.

### How to use this list

- **Pick up**: write a 1-3 sentence brief in the section below; flip status to `🚧 In progress`.
- **Wrap up (before merge)**: in the PR's own commits, flip status to `✅`, replace the brief with the PR link in the table, and update any other docs the PR's outcome affects. Land docs atomically with the code; prefer squash-merge.
- **Re-cluster**: if you find a new boundary or dependency, re-check the "no row depends on a row below" invariant.

Use as a design checklist for entity-scoped (`Creator`, `Member`, `Show`) features across PR 12 (and beyond). Which perspectives ship per sub-PR is a PRD decision; what matters is that perspectives in scope reuse one set of widgets. Canonized in the [frontend-ui-components skill](../../.agent/skills/frontend-ui-components/SKILL.md):
1. **Studio Overview** (e.g. `/finance/actuals`, `/show-operations`, creator + member roster tables)
2. **Studio Individual Overview** (e.g. `/studios/:id/creators/:creatorId`, `/studios/:id/members/:memberId`, `/studios/:id/shows/:showId` roster detail tabs)
3. **Individual Overview** (e.g. `/me/*` self-views — creator self-view in `erify_creators`, member self-view forward-looking in `erify_studios`)

PR 12.4 first lights up Perspective 1. P2 detail pages and P3 `/me/*` self-views are introduced as their host routes land — not as a same-PR delivery mandate. See [PRD §F](../prd/task-fact-binding.md#f-three-perspective-ui--reusable-component-pattern) and [design §6](../../apps/erify_api/docs/design/TASK_INPUT_FACT_BINDING_DESIGN.md#6-three-perspective-ui-consumption-map).

#### 📈 Performance Review (PR 12.4) is Upstream of Economics Review (PR 13)
PR 12 builds the **performance / quality** review surface. Late arrivals, no-shows, incomplete actuals, and platform violations are tracked here primarily because they are *damage-causing performance facts*. [PR 13's economics review surface](#pr-13--economics-review-surface) at `/studios/:id/finance/economics` is the downstream cost-reference layer that reads the same indexed columns. PR 12 never writes derived finance totals; the storage stays monetary-agnostic so the performance view remains valuable on its own. See [PRD §G](../prd/task-fact-binding.md#g-performance-review-as-upstream-of-economics-review).

**Mandated Reusable Widgets**:
- `ActualsTimelineViewer`: Shared timeline visualizing planned vs actual times.
- `PerformanceMetricsWidget`: Graphical/tabular widget for platform statistics (GMV, views).
- `CompensationBreakdownCard`: Computes base compensation, commissions, and line items.
- `AttendanceStatusBadge`: Translates timestamps into colored status highlights.
- `AuditLogTimeline`: Polymorphic audit log history renderer.

#### ⚠️ Show-Operations Task Assignment Alignment (PR 12.0.5)
Stream operations dashboards (`/show-operations`) must proactively flag and highlight shows lacking task assignments.
- **Backend (BE)**: Checks active task assignments to return `has_proper_task_assignment: boolean`.
- **Frontend (FE)**: Displays an amber/orange warning badge: ⚠️ `No Task Assigned` for any show without a valid active assignment, with a direct link to initiate task instantiation.

*Note: In alignment with PRD §2.C and database join table conventions, polymorphic targets on `AuditTarget` use `onDelete: Cascade` to cleanly purge useless junction rows when target records are deleted, while the parent `Audit` timeline envelope remains permanently preserved.*

### PR 13 · Economics review surface

**Brief** — Add `/studios/:id/finance/economics` as a cost-reference read model consuming typed show, creator, and shift facts from the 12.x extractors. Platform GMV/views (PR 12.3.1) are not cost inputs in Phase 4 so this row does not depend on 12.3.1 / 12.3.2. Revenue, contribution margin, and commission resolution stay deferred to Phase 5 (see [`pnl-revenue-workflow.md`](../prd/future/pnl-revenue-workflow.md)).

### PR 14.1 · Client mechanic catalog foundation

**Brief** — Backend + shared-contract foundation for client-owned mechanics. Entities: `ClientMechanic`, `ClientMechanicVersion`, `ClientMechanicCampaignSet`, `ClientMechanicCampaignSetItem`. New `ACCOUNT_MANAGER` studio role: mechanics management writable, planning context (shows, creator mapping) read-only, operational mutations stay admin/manager-owned, cost/compensation/finance data not accessible. UID external IDs, official Prisma migration, repository/service/controller layering, optimistic locking on mutable records, tests for client scoping, version immutability, active/retired lifecycle, set membership, role access, and money-field redaction.

### PR 14.2 · Mechanics management UI

**Brief** — Dedicated `erify_studios` surface for content teams to manage mechanics outside task templates: browse by client, manage versions, build campaign sets (mid-month / payday / doubles), retire without deleting history. Content/reference management surface — not a task-template editor.

### PR 14.3 · Task-template mechanic references

**Brief** — Extend the task-template schema so moderation fields can reference a specific mechanic version while still carrying the resolved label/description in runtime task snapshots. Template schema stays the authoring layer; generated tasks read immutable snapshots, not live catalog rows. Any `@eridu/api-types/task-management` change updates the task-template feature doc in the same PR.

### PR 14.4 · Task-template mechanic assignment matrix

**Brief** — Loop × campaign-mechanic assignment surface in the task-template builder. Pick a client/campaign set, see only that set's approved mechanic versions, assign them into loops. Cards view stays canonical for non-mechanic fields, shared fields, validation, options, conditional rules, and loop structure.

### PR 14.5 · Mechanic usage rollup + drift warnings

**Brief** — Usage and trace views before content teams edit or retire mechanic versions. Minimum rollup: mechanic version → templates and loops; campaign set → templates; template → mechanic references by loop. Warn in the builder when a linked mechanic version is retired or superseded so authors can explicitly upgrade future snapshots.

### PR 15 · Responsive Dialog → Drawer rollout in `erify_studios`

**Brief** — Surfaced during PR 4. Migrate the remaining 13 `DateTimePicker` consumers in `erify_studios` to `ResponsiveDateTimePicker` and convert mobile-reachable Dialog modals (`system-task-details-dialog`, `task-due-date-dialog`, `shift-compensation-dialog`, `schedule-dialogs`, `bulk-task-generation-dialog`, `json-form` modals, `edit-member-dialog`) to the house pattern: any mobile-reachable Dialog switches to a vaul `Drawer` below `md` via `useIsMobile()`, sharing one body component. Recipe in `.agent/skills/frontend-ui-components/references/ui-component-details.md`. Plain confirmation modals stay as `Dialog`. Verify each surface at iPhone SE (375×667). `erify_creators` rollout tracked separately.

### PR 16 · Studio-shifts export loading-state race fix

**Brief** — Surfaced during PR 4 review. PR 4 fixed the active-controller guard on `/show-operations` export so an aborted earlier export can no longer clear `isExporting` mid-flight. The same buggy pattern exists in `apps/erify_studios/src/features/studio-shifts/components/studio-shifts-table.tsx`: `setIsExporting(false)` runs unconditionally in `finally`. Move it inside the existing `exportAbortRef.current === controller` guard (one-line scope change, mirrors PR 4). No new tests needed beyond existing shifts export coverage.

### PR 17 · Entity edit dialogs → dedicated routes

**Brief** — Surfaced during PR 5 retrospective. Per-entity edits in `erify_studios` currently open Dialogs from row actions (creator roster, member roster, show, studio shift, per-show creator compensation, shift compensation, creator compensation review). Dialogs lose URL state — you can't share a link to "Alice's roster row" or hit back/forward through edits — and constrain rich detail surfaces. `task-templates/$templateId.tsx` is the existing precedent for dedicated entity routes.

Goal: convert each single-entity detail/edit dialog into a `/studios/:studioId/<entity>/:entityId` route. Confirmation modals, bulk dialogs, and inline create-from-list dialogs stay as `Dialog`. Each conversion gets its own scoped PR (one route per PR); **this row covers the audit + the first conversion** (recommend creator detail as pilot since the compensation review dialog already wants tabs).

| #   | Today                                                               | Target route                                                                       | Notes                                                                                          |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 17a | `edit-studio-creator-dialog` + `creator-compensation-review-dialog` | `/studios/:studioId/creators/:creatorId`                                           | Pilot. Detail page hosts defaults edit, compensation review (tab), and per-show drill-in.      |
| 17b | `edit-member-dialog`                                                | `/studios/:studioId/members/:memberId`                                             | Wait for PR 8 so the route uses the string wire type.                                          |
| 17c | `show-update-dialog`                                                | `/studios/:studioId/shows/:showId` (detail route alongside the existing list page) | Show-creator compensation becomes a section; `show-actuals-dialog` folds in alongside PR 12.1. |
| 17d | `studio-shift-form-dialog` + `shift-compensation-dialog`            | `/studios/:studioId/shifts/:shiftId`                                               | Compensation becomes a tab/section.                                                            |

**Out of scope** — Confirmation/destructive dialogs (`delete-*`, `remove-*`), inline add-to-list dialogs (`add-studio-creator`, `add-member`, `add-creator`), bulk dialogs (`bulk-task-generation`, `bulk-creator-assignment`), and task-scoped sub-forms (`system-task-details`, `task-due-date`, `compensation-line-item-form`).

**Audit deliverable** for this row: a short doc at `apps/erify_studios/docs/ENTITY_DETAIL_ROUTES.md` listing target route per entity, share-link contract (which query params survive), and migration order. Then 17a opens with the pilot conversion. Each follow-up PR maintains studio scoping, optimistic-concurrency `version` round-trip, and reuses existing payload-builder helpers.

### PR 18 · Creator-rate wire-type migration

**Brief** — Surfaced during PR 5 review. `defaultRateInputSchema` / `defaultCommissionRateInputSchema` in `packages/api-types/src/studio-creators/schemas.ts` are `z.coerce.number()`, so any decimal string from the FE is coerced through a JS number before the controller re-stringifies it. Last creator-side money path on a JS number, inconsistent with the `Big`/string contract from PR 1 + Finance Guardrail #2. Migrate both helpers to `z.string()` end-to-end across all three consumers (`createStudioCreatorRosterInputSchema`, `updateStudioCreatorRosterInputSchema`, `updateStudioShowCreatorInputSchema`), keep `superRefine` invariants, parse decimals at the persistence boundary, and update the FE forms / payload builders to send strings directly. No DB migration needed.

### PR 19 · System creator rate wire-type migration

**Brief** — Surfaced during PR 8 audit (2026-05-18). `createCreatorInputSchema` / `updateCreatorInputSchema` in `packages/api-types/src/creators/schemas.ts` coerce `default_rate` / `default_commission_rate` through `z.coerce.number()` even though the response is already `z.string().nullable()`. Migrate input schemas to `z.string()` end-to-end on `/admin/creators/*`. Independent of PR 18 (different surfaces); ships in any order.

### PR 20 · Show inline creator-rate wire-type migration

**Brief** — Surfaced during PR 8 audit. `updateShowInputSchema.creators[]` in `packages/api-types/src/shows/schemas.ts` uses `z.coerce.number()` for `agreed_rate` / `commission_rate`, duplicating the helpers PR 18 migrates. After PR 18 lands, either inline the new `z.string()` shape or extract a shared helper from `studio-creators/schemas.ts` and consume it from both places. Mirror the BE/FE updates done in PR 18.

## Out of scope (post-Phase-4)

Each item has an extension sketch in cost-model §4:

- Revenue (P-side), commission resolution, contribution margin → [`pnl-revenue-workflow.md`](../prd/future/pnl-revenue-workflow.md)
- Settlement, freeze, grace tolerance, payment processing, bank-statement reconciliation
- Recipient acknowledgement, dispute, recipient-initiated adjustments
- Notifications when manager edits actuals
- Standing / schedule-scoped / global / recurring / HR line items
- Hardware / creator-app actuals automation beyond task submission and manager entry
- Additional typed platform performance metrics beyond GMV/views
- Advanced compensation rule engine
- Studio schedule management — deferred 2026-04-22; Google Sheets remains the scheduling path. Materials at [`studio-schedule-management.md`](../prd/future/studio-schedule-management.md) and the two `STUDIO_SCHEDULE_MANAGEMENT_DESIGN.md` design docs.

## Definition of Done

Phase 4 closes when every row in the PR table is `✅`. The cost-model contract remains the locked semantic source; this phase doc tracks status only.

## Verification gates per PR

```
pnpm --filter erify_api    lint && pnpm --filter erify_api    typecheck && pnpm --filter erify_api    test && pnpm --filter erify_api    build
pnpm --filter erify_studios lint && pnpm --filter erify_studios typecheck && pnpm --filter erify_studios test && pnpm --filter erify_studios build
```

App-local design docs land alongside the implementation PR only when a PR introduces a novel pattern.
